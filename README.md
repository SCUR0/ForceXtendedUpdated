![ForceXtended Rainmeter Skin](https://github.com/SCUR0/ForceXtended/raw/master/preview.png)

## Changes Made From Original

GPU usage and NVRAM support without plugins for windows 10

System now shows build version for windows 10

CPU skin was updated to support 32 cores.

CPU core measurement updated to rainmeter CPU measure plugin. This now uses less resources and fixes bugs present on old cpu skin.

Clock set to 12 hour cycle by default. This can still be changed in `\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\ForceXtendedUpdated\Config.inc` under `DateTime`.

Temp plugin switched to [CoreTemp](http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/).

If temperature plugin is not found, temperature will be removed from CPU skin dynamically.

Changed network to google.com and updated IP pull to checkip.dyndns.org


## About

This was an old favorite skin that lacked support for newer processors and had an annoying bug with inverted core measurements after waking computer from sleep. The creators appeared to have abandoned it so I took it into my hands to update. This skin is forked and updated from ForceXtended by [mallchin](https://github.com/mallchin/ForceXtended).

## Install

Skin installer located in [releases.](https://github.com/SCUR0/ForceXtendedUpdated/releases)

## Dependencies

  * [CoreTemp](http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/) for CPU temp but is not required.
